# Combat

Combat is an environment that simulates a battle between two teams of agents. The agents move around a square grid and may attack opponent agents within their 5x5 field of view. In this environment the opponent team follows a fix strategy to attack the nearest agent and move towards the nearest agent if none are in range. Various algorithms are trained to play against this strategy.
